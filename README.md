> üõ°Ô∏è **NEW: Docker MCP Gateway Interceptor Demo** - Check out the `interceptor-demo` branch to see enterprise-grade security, compliance, and business logic enforcement in action! See [INTERCEPTOR_DEMO.md](./INTERCEPTOR_DEMO.md) for details.

# üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements

+ **[Docker Desktop] 4.43.0+ or [Docker Engine]** installed.
+ **ONE** of the following:
  - **OpenAI API key** (recommended - no local resources needed)
  - **700MB+ VRAM** for ultra-lightweight models
  - **2GB+ VRAM** for good performance local models

### Super Quick Start (Recommended)

```sh
git checkout interceptor-demo

# Automatic setup - detects your system and chooses best model
chmod +x quick-fix.sh
./quick-fix.sh

# Run the interceptor demo
./demo-interceptors.sh
```

**That's it!** The quick-fix script will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Detect your system capabilities (VRAM, memory)
- ‚úÖ Choose the optimal model configuration
- ‚úÖ Fix common issues automatically
- ‚úÖ Start the services with appropriate settings

## ü§ñ Model Options (All Lightweight!)

Don't have powerful hardware? No problem! We support ultra-lightweight models:

### 1. üåü OpenAI API (Recommended)
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
./quick-fix.sh
```
- **VRAM needed:** 0MB
- **Cost:** ~$0.50-2.00 per session
- **Performance:** Excellent

### 2. üî¨ TinyLlama (Ultra-lightweight)
```sh
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.tinyllama.yaml up --build -d
```
- **VRAM needed:** 700MB (works on most laptops!)
- **Download:** 700MB
- **Performance:** Basic but functional

### 3. ‚ö° Phi3-mini (Good performance)
```sh
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.local-model.yaml up --build -d
```
- **VRAM needed:** 2GB
- **Download:** 2.3GB
- **Performance:** Good

### 4. üß≠ Let the system choose for you
```sh
./select-model.sh  # Interactive model selection
```

## Manual Setup (If you prefer to do it yourself)

```sh
# Set up secrets
export BRAVE_API_KEY=<your_brave_api_key>
export RESEND_API_KEY=<resend_api_key>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai_api_key>  # Optional but recommended
make gateway-secrets

# Choose ONE of these startup options:

# Option A: OpenAI API (0MB VRAM needed)
echo "sk-your-openai-key" > secret.openai-api-key
docker compose up --build -d

# Option B: Ultra-lightweight TinyLlama (700MB VRAM)
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.tinyllama.yaml up --build -d

# Option C: Good performance Phi3-mini (2GB VRAM)
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.local-model.yaml up --build -d

# Option D: Custom model selection
# Edit compose.lightweight-models.yaml to uncomment your preferred model
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.lightweight-models.yaml up --build -d
```

For ARM64 macOS users:
```sh
DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 docker pull roberthouse224/catalogue
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Interceptor Demo Features

The interceptor demo showcases:
- **üîí Secret Detection:** Prevents API key leakage - try submitting "api_key=sk-123..."
- **üìä Tool Monitoring:** Usage tracking and rate limiting - make 25+ rapid requests
- **üè™ Business Logic:** Domain-specific rule enforcement - try price under $5.00
- **üßπ Content Filtering:** Output sanitization - mention "adidas" and see it filtered

## üåê Access Points

- **üõ°Ô∏è Interceptor Dashboard:** http://localhost:8090 (real-time security monitoring)
- **üõí Sock Store:** http://localhost:9090 (the demo store)
- **ü§ñ Agent Portal:** http://localhost:3000 (submit vendor requests here!)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Model Too Big" Error?
```sh
# Try the automatic fix first
./quick-fix.sh

# Or manually use the tiniest model
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.tinyllama.yaml up --build -d
```

### UI Content Errors?
```sh
docker compose restart adk adk-ui
```

### Want to see all model options?
```sh
./select-model.sh
```

### Still having issues?
- See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed help
- Check service health: `docker compose ps`
- View logs: `docker compose logs adk`

## üìä Model Comparison

| Model          | VRAM    | Download | Performance | Best For           |
|----------------|---------|----------|-------------|--------------------|
| **OpenAI API** | **0MB** | **0MB**  | **Excellent** | **Production use** |
| TinyLlama      | 700MB   | 700MB    | Basic       | Minimal systems    |
| Phi3-mini      | 2GB     | 2.3GB    | Good        | Most laptops       |
| Gemma 2B       | 1.5GB   | 1.6GB    | Fair        | Mid-range systems  |
| Llama 3.2 3B   | 2GB     | 2.0GB    | Good        | Balanced choice    |
| Mistral 7B     | 4GB     | 4.1GB    | Very Good   | High-end systems   |

# ‚ùì What Can It Do?

Example input to the portal:

> "I am a sock vendor named Nike. Perhaps you've heard of us. We provide colorful compressions socks,
> that are elegant and affordable.  Our Nike compression socks are 12.99 each.  
> Here are some urls to images of the socks <https://tinyurl.com/5n6spnvu> and
> <https://tinyurl.com/mv8ebjnh>"

With interceptors enabled, this submission will:
1. üîç Be scanned for secrets/credentials (none found - ‚úÖ allowed)
2. üìä Get logged for usage monitoring and compliance
3. üè™ Pass business rule validation (price above $5.00 minimum - ‚úÖ valid)
4. üßπ Have any competitor mentions filtered in the response

Try these test scenarios:
- üîí **Secret detection:** "Our API key is sk-1234567890abcdef" (gets blocked!)
- üí∞ **Business rules:** "Cheap socks for $2.99" (gets rejected!)
- üè¢ **Content filter:** "Better than adidas products" (gets filtered!)

# ü§ù Agent Roles

| **Agent**   | **Tools Used**        | **Role Description**                                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Supplier Intake**  |  None                | Researches a new sock vendor and decides whether to onboard them to the store |
| **Reddit Research**  |  BraveSearch via MCP | Searches for reviews on the vendor                             |
| **Customer Review**  |  MongoDB via MCP     | Match styles against historical buyer data to see if it's a match for the store |
| **Catalog**          |  curl via MCP        | Adds the product sku to the catalog if we like the product |

**All agent interactions are now secured and monitored by Docker MCP Gateway interceptors!**

# üßπ Cleanup

To stop and remove containers and volumes:

```sh
docker compose down -v
```
