# üõ°Ô∏è Docker MCP Gateway Interceptor Demo

> **Showcasing the Power of Docker MCP Gateway Interceptors for Enterprise AI Security**

This branch demonstrates the advanced **interceptor framework** in Docker MCP Gateway, which provides enterprise-grade security, compliance, and business logic enforcement for AI agent interactions.

## üéØ What Are Interceptors?

Interceptors are powerful middleware components that can:
- **Intercept and inspect** every tool call before and after execution
- **Block malicious or inappropriate requests** based on configurable rules  
- **Filter and modify content** to ensure compliance and brand consistency
- **Log and monitor** all AI agent activities for audit and analytics
- **Enforce business logic** specific to your organization

Think of interceptors as **security guards** and **business rule enforcers** that sit between your AI agents and your tools, ensuring safe and compliant interactions.

## üöÄ Demo Interceptors

This demo includes four production-ready interceptors:

### 1. üîí Secret Detector (`secret_detector.sh`)
**Purpose:** Prevents accidental secret leakage  
**Triggers:** Before tool execution  
**Actions:**
- Scans for API keys, tokens, passwords in requests
- Blocks requests containing potential secrets
- Supports patterns for OpenAI, GitHub, Slack tokens

**Example:** Blocks requests containing `sk-1234567890abcdef...` or `ghp_abcdef123456...`

### 2. üìä Tool Monitor (`tool_monitor.sh`)  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive usage tracking and rate limiting  
**Triggers:** Before tool execution  
**Actions:**
- Logs all tool calls with timestamps and arguments
- Implements rate limiting (20 calls per tool per session)
- Detects suspicious destructive operations
- Creates audit trails in JSON format

**Example:** Warns if MongoDB delete operations are attempted

### 3. üè™ Sock Store Business Logic (`sock_store_business.sh`)
**Purpose:** Domain-specific business rule enforcement  
**Triggers:** Before tool execution  
**Actions:**
- Validates minimum price ($5.00) for products
- Blocks banned/counterfeit brands
- Auto-categorizes products (Athletic, Formal, Casual)
- Enriches vendor data with metadata
- Enforces required fields validation

**Example:** Rejects vendors with prices below $5.00 threshold

### 4. üßπ Content Filter (`content_filter.sh`)
**Purpose:** Output sanitization and brand compliance  
**Triggers:** After tool execution  
**Actions:**
- Removes competitor brand mentions
- Redacts sensitive data (emails, phone numbers)
- Applies brand-consistent terminology
- Adds compliance disclaimers
- Filters inappropriate language

**Example:** Replaces "adidas socks" with "[COMPETITOR_NAME] socks"

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop 4.43.0+ with MCP Toolkit enabled
- OpenAI API key (recommended) OR sufficient VRAM for local models

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajeetraina/sock-store-demo
cd sock-store-demo
git checkout interceptor-demo

# Set up secrets (replace with your actual keys)
export BRAVE_API_KEY=<your_brave_api_key>
export RESEND_API_KEY=<resend_api_key>  
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai_api_key>
make gateway-secrets
```

### 2. Choose Your AI Model

#### Option A: OpenAI API (Recommended - No VRAM needed)
```bash
# Default configuration uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
docker compose up --build -d
```

#### Option B: Smaller Local Model (Requires ~2GB VRAM)
```bash
# Use Phi3-mini instead of large Qwen3 model
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.local-model.yaml up --build -d
```

### 3. Run the Interceptor Demo
```bash
# Make the demo script executable
chmod +x demo-interceptors.sh

# Run the comprehensive demo
./demo-interceptors.sh
```

### 4. Access the Dashboards
- **Sock Store:** http://localhost:9090
- **Agent Portal:** http://localhost:3000  
- **Interceptor Dashboard:** http://localhost:8090

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Model Too Big" Error
If you see `unable to load runner: model too big`:

1. **Use OpenAI API (recommended):**
   ```bash
   # Restart with default configuration
   docker compose down
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

2. **Use smaller local model:**
   ```bash
   # Use Phi3-mini (only 2GB VRAM needed)
   docker compose down
   docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.local-model.yaml up --build -d
   ```

3. **Check system resources:**
   ```bash
   # On systems with GPU
   nvidia-smi  # Check VRAM usage
   docker system df  # Check Docker disk usage
   ```

### UI Content Errors
If the Agent Portal shows errors:
```bash
# Check ADK service logs
docker compose logs adk

# Restart if needed
docker compose restart adk adk-ui
```

### Missing Interceptor Logs
If interceptor logs aren't appearing:
```bash
# Check if interceptors are mounted correctly
docker compose exec mcp-gateway ls -la /interceptors/

# Verify log directory
docker compose exec mcp-gateway ls -la /var/log/

# Try making a test request to generate logs
```

## üìã Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Secret Leakage Prevention
Try submitting a vendor description containing an API key:
```
"Our API integration uses key sk-1234567890abcdef for authentication"
```
**Expected:** Request blocked by secret detector

### Scenario 2: Business Rule Enforcement  
Submit a low-price product:
```
"Discount socks for only $2.99 each"
```
**Expected:** Rejected for being below $5.00 minimum

### Scenario 3: Content Filtering
Submit text mentioning competitors:
```
"These are better than adidas and nike products"
```
**Expected:** Competitor names replaced with [COMPETITOR_NAME]

### Scenario 4: Rate Limiting
Submit 25+ rapid requests to the same tool
**Expected:** Rate limiting warnings in logs

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Real-time Log Monitoring
```bash
# Watch interceptor activity live
docker compose exec mcp-gateway tail -f /var/log/mcp-interceptors.log

# View tool usage analytics  
docker compose exec mcp-gateway cat /var/log/mcp/tool_usage.jsonl
```

### Dashboard Features
The included dashboard (port 8090) provides:
- Real-time interceptor status
- Usage statistics and metrics  
- Security event alerts
- Business rule application logs

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Adding Custom Interceptors

1. **Create interceptor script:**
```bash
cat > interceptors/my_custom_interceptor.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Custom interceptor logic here
input=$(cat)
# Process and validate input
echo "$input"
EOF

chmod +x interceptors/my_custom_interceptor.sh
```

2. **Add to compose.yaml:**
```yaml
command:
  - --interceptor=before:exec:/interceptors/my_custom_interceptor.sh
```

### Interceptor Syntax
```bash
--interceptor=<when>:<type>:<path>
```
- **when:** `before` (pre-execution) or `after` (post-execution)
- **type:** Currently supports `exec` (executable scripts)
- **path:** Absolute path to interceptor script

### Environment Variables
Interceptors have access to:
- `HTTP_USER_AGENT` - Client identification
- `SESSION_ID` - Session tracking (if set)
- Standard input contains the tool call/response data

## üè≠ Production Deployment

### Security Considerations
- Interceptor scripts run with gateway container privileges
- Use read-only mounts for interceptor files
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Consider resource limits for interceptor execution

### Performance Optimization  
- Keep interceptor logic lightweight and fast
- Use asynchronous logging where possible
- Implement caching for repeated validations
- Monitor interceptor execution time

### Scaling Patterns
- Interceptors scale with gateway instances
- Shared state can be maintained via external stores
- Consider circuit breakers for external validations

## üéì Learning Outcomes

After running this demo, you'll understand:

1. **Security Layer:** How interceptors provide defense-in-depth
2. **Compliance Enforcement:** Automated policy application
3. **Business Logic Integration:** Domain-specific rule enforcement  
4. **Observability:** Comprehensive monitoring and auditing
5. **Extensibility:** Framework for custom interceptor development

## üÜö Without vs With Interceptors

### Without Interceptors ‚ùå
- AI agents have direct, unmonitored tool access
- No protection against secret leakage
- Business rules must be implemented in each agent
- Limited visibility into tool usage
- Compliance violations possible

### With Interceptors ‚úÖ  
- All tool calls filtered through security layers
- Automatic secret detection and blocking
- Centralized business rule enforcement
- Complete audit trail of all activities  
- Guaranteed compliance with organizational policies
